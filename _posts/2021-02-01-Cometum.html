      The Company
    </h4>


    <p class="post-content-text">
      Cometum's mission is to reinvent private banking. The company's services are aimed at high net worth individuals and High-Networth-Millennials.
    <br>
      The private account at Cometum opens up unique opportunities for the customer. One of the start-up's core innovations is the possibility to participate in alternative investments such as works of art, classic cars, real estate projects and more via participatory loans. This is done by tokenising the corresponding assets:
    <br>
      A cryptocurrency is created that is backed by the value of the asset. The user can now buy tokens and trade them. Through this innovation, investments in very high-priced assets that were previously associated with great risks can be diversified and made accessible to a broader community.

      The Challange
    </h4>


    <p class="post-content-text">
      Acquiring and trading in participatory loans is a complex legal process. A user should be guided through this process as smoothly as possible, while still understanding the key risks and terms of the investment.
    <br>
      The registration process also had to perform a balancing act: The process had to be legally flawless and meet the high standards of the liability umbrella, but it still had to be easily accessible to the user.
    <br>
      Ultimately, the user had to be provided with a high-value, intuitively operable application for managing and trading his or her assets.

    <h4 class="post-content-title">
      Preconditions
    </h4>


    <p class="post-content-text">
      When I got to know the start-up, it already had a functional frontend, which, however, did not yet meet the quality requirements of an aspiring private bank. We wanted to embrace the name Cometum together with the iconic logo, as it opened up a lot of creative freedom. However, a uniform style guide had not yet been elaborated.
    </p>

    <h4 class="post-content-title">
      Approach
    </h4>


    <p class="post-content-text">
      A uniform style guide and a component system still had to be defined to create a scalable basis for a consistent and beautiful UI design. For the colour scheme, we opted for darker and more sophisticated colours, such as dark blue and hunter green, and combined them with a lighter ochre as an action colour.
    <br>
    To make UI elements stand out in a pleasing way despite the dark colours, we added soft geometric patterns to the background of the Application.
    <br>
      In order to create an objective assessment standard and to be able to better evaluate the design, we agreed as a team on a 4-word filter consisting of 4 adjectives that best describe Cometum.
    </p>

      Determined down to the smallest detail
    </h1>


    <img class="post-img" src="/assets/img/IMG-Cometum5.jpg" alt="Cometum 404 Error page">


    <p class="post-content-text">
      Many UI designers tend to overlook a lot of little things that ultimately affect the user's overall experience. That's why, together with Cometum, I made sure to define processes precisely in order to provide appropriate error messages and fill loading times with transitions. Even a lovingly designed 404 page can make the difference between an angry and frustrated or a forgiving and kind user reaction.

        Automotive automobiles are one of the major subjects of our time in the field of technology, transportation and artificial intelligence. Machines have become more and more intelligent and independent, but they still lack many basic "human" characteristics that we take for granted. We have not yet succeeded in teaching a machine such a thing as "common sense". A human taxi driver knows whether instead of stopping at the exact address given, he prefers to drive 10 meters further, because it is easier to get off the car there, and a human taxi driver also notices that the passenger has not yet taken his luggage out of the trunk and does not simply drive on.

        Well designed, intuitively usable software should prevent these communication difficulties and enable the smoothest possible handling of this new type of technology.
        Exactly this challenge was set in a university project within the scope of my studies. The task was to build an app that would allow an autonomous taxi to be completely remote controlled. In addition, a suitable corporate design and a functional prototype had to be built. In the mockups you can see parts of my version of the app, which I named "flink".

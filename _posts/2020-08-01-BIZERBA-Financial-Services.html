    About the company
  </h4>

  <p class="post-content-text">
      BIZERBA Financial Services belongs to Bizerba SE & Co. KG, a leading German manufacturer of scales with headquarters in Balingen.  The brand was created to provide a leasing service for corporate clients. It offers a wide range of vehicles from two-wheelers and cars to trucks and excavators, as well as machinery such as Cuba robots and CNC lathes, and of course BIZERBA's own products: scales, cutting machines, labeling machines.

    The challange
  </h4>

  <p class="post-content-text">
      To give its customers a better overview of all leased products and to facilitate customer support, the decision was made to develop a progressive Webapp for BIZERBA Financial Services.
    </p>


  <h4 class="post-content-title">
    Preconditions
  </h4>

  <p class="post-content-text">
      In its design guidelines, BIZERBA envisages color tones from white to dark gray and a light blue as an action color. The Arial font is used for the font.
    </p>


  <h4 class="post-content-title">
    Approach
  </h4>

  <p class="post-content-text">
      In visual imagery, BIZERBA is primarily associated with the smooth, matt metal surfaces of its mechanical products with their haptic buttons. Even a simple Google image search with the search term "BIZERBA" will show the viewer numerous pictures of the company's products with just this look. Therefore, the decision was made to reflect this image world through the skeuomorphic style of the web application.

      The Company
    </h4>

    <p class="post-content-text">
      This German FinTech start-up has a special significance for me, as I am fortunate enough to hold a stake in it myself. It was founded in October 2018 by Werner Kräutlein, a friend of mine. Volksbank Mittweida and 2bAHEAD decided to fund WechselGott with the first €300,000 of venture capital.
    <br>
      Since then, it has grown rapidly. The number of employees has grown to 25 people and other companies have invested over €3.5 million. The company's goal is to relieve people of the headache associated with managing their finances and to develop a contract management solution that is easier than ever before.

    <h4 class="post-content-title">
      The Challange
    </h4>

    <p class="post-content-text">
      Let's face it: we all hate dealing with our contracts and subscriptions. Especially the subject insurance is about as sexy as a pair of slippers and we often put it off for a long time to take care of it - sometimes unfortunately too long.
    <br>
      Many people have also never changed their electricity or gas supplier out of sheer convenience and receive their electricity from the basic supplier, usually at exorbitant prices.  And we have all had the experience of missing the cancellation deadline for a subscription, so that we were allowed to pay for another year - for example, the gym subscription, of which we have made heavy use about 4 times.
    <br>
      WechselGott's mission is to unfuck finance.
    </p>


    <h4 class="post-content-title">
      Preconditions
    </h4>

    <p class="post-content-text">
      We had to build the WechselGott brand and the underlying design system from scratch together with external consultants and design experts and refine it over the years. While at the beginning the focus was on making the frontend as lean and purely functional as possible without bells and whistles, now it is increasingly about making the use of the WechselGott app an experience and the design beautiful and unique.

    <h4 class="post-content-title">
      Approach
    </h4>

    <p class="post-content-text">
      Since we want to stir up the old-fashioned financial industry and provoke in a playful way, we went for the spicy name WechselGott (german for: God of switching contracts) and opted for bright and friendly colors and color gradients and joyfull Illustrations.

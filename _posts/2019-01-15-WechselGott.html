excerpt: <p class="excerpt-content">This German FinTech Start Up, has a special meaning for me, because I myself hold a stake in it. It was founded in Oktober 2018 by Werner Kräutlein, a friend of mine. Volksbank Mittweida and 2bAHEAD decided to fund WechselGott with venture capital. Since then it has grown rapidly.</p>

        Let's be honest: We all hate to deal with our contracts and subscriptions. Insurance is a tiresome topic for most people and we put it off taking care of it for as long as possible - sometimes unfortunately too long. Many people are afraid of changing their electricity and gas provider, so they prefer to get their electricity from the basic provider for much higher prices. And we've all experienced it before, having missed the cancellation date for a subscription, so that we were allowed to pay for another year - for example, the gym subscription, which we've only used a solid five times anyway.

        But all these tiresome issues can be handled completely automatically with today's technology.
        When WechselGott founder Werner Kräutlein told me about his idea for a fully automated contract manager, I was immediately hooked.
        WelchselGott was going to use artificial intelligence to recognize contracts from bank transactions and then automatically compare them and optimize them either at the touch of a button or using the autopilot function without any user intervention.

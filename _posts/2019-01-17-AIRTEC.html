        Airtec is a young but very ambitious trade fair in the rapidly growing aerospace sector. The great challenge we have set ourselves is to offer a platform where traditional and conservatively structured companies on the one hand, but also visionary, future-driven pioneers, for example in the field of electronic air mobility, can feel at ease and present their products and services.
        Since my joint project with Airtec is still in progress, several mockups will follow in the near future. But this post should give a first insight into this exciting project.

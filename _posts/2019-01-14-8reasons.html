excerpt: <p class="excerpt-content">In early 2018 I got to know Alex Varro, a very ambitious, creative guy who had founded the UX-agency 8reasons. The connection was great and since then I have been working regularly for his company as a freelance designer.</p>

    <p class="post-content-text">
        Since 2018, 8reasons is the new lead agency for the German company Maschinenringe.
        This company is specialized in providing agricultural companies with a platform where they can purchase all the necessary resources und work equipment. This includes diesel for tractors, fertilizers, animal feed and heavy-duty vehicles.
        Maschinenringe has now set itself the major goal of digitising its entire platform. All products are to be available for ordering simply by pressing a button. In addition, on a digital basis, it is possible to provide farmers with tools to send them important information on a regular basis or to speed up legal tasks. Providing a farmer regularly with the relevant weather data and forecasts is no longer a problem these days. It is also possible to provide him with map applications with which you can soon measure your land, calculate the area and then send it to a registration office.
        Building digital applications for these and many other uses was our challenge at 8reasons.
